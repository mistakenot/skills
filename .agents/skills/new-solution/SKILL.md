description: "Writes a solution design (solution.md) for an existing task by exploring approaches and tradeoffs. Use when 'write a solution', 'design the solution', 'new solution', 'explore approaches', or after requirements have been approved. Not applicable when requirements.md doesn't exist yet."

# New Solution

Read approved requirements, gather codebase context, explore approaches, write `solution.md` and `context.md`.

> Part of the task planning workflow. See [references/workflow-overview.md](references/workflow-overview.md) for the full pipeline.

## Guiding Principles

- If multiple approaches exist, surface them all with tradeoffs -- don't silently pick one.
- Bias toward the simplest approach. If a simpler option exists, say so even if it's less elegant.
- No speculative abstractions or "flexibility" that wasn't requested. The solution should be the minimum design that satisfies the acceptance criteria.
- If something in the requirements is ambiguous, stop and ask before designing around an assumption.

## Process

1. **Find task folder** -- identify the active task from recent context, user input, or by scanning `docs/tasks/` for the latest folder. Read `requirements.md`. Verify all Open Questions are resolved -- if not, resolve them first.
2. **Scan skills** -- check available skills for topic matches relevant to this task's domain. Load matched skills.
3. **Gather codebase context** -- spawn 2 parallel subagents to ground the solution design in codebase reality before choosing an approach.

   **CB1 (Code):**
   - Search files, functions, types, and patterns relevant to the task
   - Find similar implementations in the codebase for pattern reference
   - Note existing conventions and constraints that will shape the solution

   **CB2 (Docs):**
   - Search project documentation for relevant how-tos, concept docs, and architecture guides
   - Check for related rules or conventions that apply
   - Note any documented constraints or patterns the implementation must follow
   - Run `auto search quickstart` to discover available search tools, then use the best fit if useful

   Collect findings from both subagents before proceeding.

4. **Assess complexity** (informed by context):
   - **Straightforward** (one obvious approach): go directly to step 6.
   - **Ambiguous** (multiple viable approaches): go to step 5.
5. **Explore options** -- spawn parallel subagents, one per candidate approach. Each subagent investigates feasibility using the gathered context, checking patterns, and identifying risks. Collect results. Present a comparison table to the user with pros/cons for each option. Wait for the user to pick an approach.
6. **Write solution.md** -- use the template and rules below. Fill in Approach, Files, Test Coverage, Out of Scope, and Rejected Alternatives. The gathered context should inform file paths, patterns, and conventions used in the solution. If requirements.md has `epic:` frontmatter, copy it to solution.md.
7. **Write context.md** -- combine the findings from step 3 into `context.md` in the task folder using the context template below. Include only verified facts -- paths, snippets, descriptions grounded in actual code. If requirements.md has `epic:` frontmatter, copy it to context.md.
8. **Create artifacts** -- if the solution involves user-facing flows or complex architecture, create artifact files (wireframes, diagrams) in the task folder. Follow the artifact guidelines below.
9. **Validate assumptions** -- before presenting the docs, review every design decision you made and identify any that were NOT clearly dictated by (a) the requirements or (b) pre-established patterns in the repository. Decisions that are obvious from context or instructions don't need confirmation. But if you chose an approach, structure, behavior, or tradeoff that the user didn't explicitly ask for and that isn't a clear convention in the codebase, you MUST surface it. Use the `AskUserQuestion` tool to double-check these assumptions with the user. When asking questions: always include a free-text "Other" option so the user can be more descriptive if none of the choices fit. Record all user responses in solution.md (under the relevant section or as an appendix) for traceability. Update solution.md with their answers before proceeding. The goal is to catch decisions the user would regret later when reviewing the implementation.
10. **Hard-stop** -- present the completed solution.md and context.md to the user. Do NOT proceed to the plan stage. Tell them: "Review solution.md and context.md. When ready, run `/new-plan` to continue."
